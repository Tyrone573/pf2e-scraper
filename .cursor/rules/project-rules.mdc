# Development Rules and Best Practices

This document outlines the best practices and rules for working with our Next.js template project. Following these guidelines will ensure code quality, maintainability, and consistency across the codebase.

## General Principles

1. **Write Clean, Readable Code**
   - Use meaningful variable and function names
   - Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
   - Comment complex logic, but let code be self-documenting when possible

2. **Prioritize Type Safety**
   - Use TypeScript types for all variables, function parameters, and return values
   - Avoid using `any` type unless absolutely necessary
   - Create interfaces and types for complex data structures

3. **Follow the DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)**
   - Extract repeated logic into reusable functions or components
   - Use utility functions from `src/frontend/lib/utils.ts` for common operations

4. **Optimize for Performance**
   - Use React Server Components when possible
   - Implement proper data fetching strategies
   - Minimize client-side JavaScript

## React and Next.js Best Practices

1. **Component Structure**
   - Keep components small and focused
   - Use composition over inheritance
   - Split large components into smaller, reusable pieces

2. **State Management**
   - Use React hooks for local state
   - Keep state as close as possible to where it's used
   - Consider React Context for global state when necessary

3. **Data Fetching**
   - Use Server Components for data fetching when possible
   - Implement proper error handling and loading states
   - Use the API functions in `src/backend/api/` for Supabase operations

4. **Routing**
   - Follow the Next.js App Router conventions
   - Use dynamic routes for parameterized pages
   - Implement proper loading and error states for routes

## Tailwind CSS Guidelines

1. **Class Organization**
   - Group related classes together (layout, typography, colors, etc.)
   - Use the `cn()` utility for conditional classes
   - Extract repeated class combinations into components

2. **Responsive Design**
   - Design for mobile-first, then add responsive variants
   - Use Tailwind's responsive prefixes consistently (sm, md, lg, xl)
   - Test all components across different screen sizes

3. **Custom Styling**
   - Extend Tailwind's theme in `tailwind.config.cjs` instead of using custom CSS
   - Use CSS variables for theme values that need to be shared
   - Keep custom CSS to a minimum

## Supabase and Database Guidelines

1. **Data Access**
   - Use the API functions in `src/backend/api/` for all Supabase operations
   - Implement proper error handling for all database operations
   - Use TypeScript types for database entities

2. **Security**
   - Never expose Supabase service keys in client-side code
   - Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all tables
   - Validate user input before sending to the database

3. **Migrations**
   - Create a new migration for each database schema change
   - Test migrations thoroughly before applying to production
   - Always include both `up.sql` and `down.sql` for each migration

## Code Quality and Testing

1. **Code Formatting**
   - Follow the project's ESLint and Prettier configurations
   - Run linting before committing code
   - Fix all warnings and errors before submitting pull requests

2. **Testing**
   - Write tests for critical functionality
   - Test components in isolation
   - Implement end-to-end tests for critical user flows

3. **Documentation**
   - Document complex functions and components
   - Update documentation when making significant changes
   - Include examples for reusable components

## Deployment

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit sensitive environment variables
   - Use different environment variables for development and production
   - Document all required environment variables

2. **Build Process**
   - Test the build locally before deploying
   - Ensure all dependencies are properly installed
   - Verify that the application works in production mode

3. **Monitoring**
   - Implement error tracking
   - Monitor performance metrics
   - Set up alerts for critical issues

## LLM-Specific Guidelines

When using LLMs (Large Language Models) to assist with development:

1. **Code Generation**
   - Always review and understand generated code before using it
   - Test generated code thoroughly
   - Refactor generated code to match project conventions

2. **Documentation**
   - Use LLMs to help document complex functionality
   - Verify that generated documentation is accurate
   - Edit generated documentation to match project style

3. **Problem Solving**
   - Use LLMs to explore different approaches to problems
   - Combine LLM suggestions with your own expertise
   - Always validate LLM solutions against project requirements

4. **Learning**
   - Use LLMs to explain unfamiliar concepts or technologies
   - Ask for examples when learning new patterns
   - Verify information from LLMs with official documentation

## Project Documentation and Workflow Guidelines

1. **Feature Request Process**
   - Review `docs/requirements.md` for every new feature request
   - Review `docs/projectstructure.md` to ensure proper code organization
   - Review `docs/techstack.md` to ensure using correct tools and technologies
   - Follow established patterns and conventions from these documents

2. **Project Roadmap Management**
   - Use `docs/project-roadmap.md` as the single source of truth for work
   - Only perform tasks that are explicitly listed in the project roadmap
   - Track task completion by updating the project roadmap
   - Document any blockers or dependencies in the roadmap

3. **Code Documentation**
   - No inline comments in code
   - Comments are only allowed at the function level
   - Use self-documenting code practices
   - Keep function-level comments focused on explaining complex logic or important decisions

By following these guidelines, we can maintain a high-quality codebase that is easy to understand, extend, and maintain over time.
