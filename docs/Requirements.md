# Pathfinder 2E Traits Data Collection System Requirements

## Project Overview
This system will collect, process, and display trait information from the Pathfinder 2E Archives of Nethys website, specifically focusing on the traits page and its associated content.

## Functional Requirements

- System shall connect to https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx
- System shall navigate through all links on the main traits page
- System shall extract text content from linked pages
- System shall maintain connection information for each piece of data

### 2. Data Processing
- System shall remove duplicate entries
- System shall categorize data into logical sections
- System shall filter out non-essential information
- System shall identify and mark legacy content
- System shall maintain source attribution for each trait

### 3. Data Organization
- System shall sort all traits alphabetically
- System shall structure each trait entry to include:
  - Trait name
  - Trait description
  - Legacy content indicator
  - Source information

### 4. Display Interface
- System shall present data in a clean, readable format
- System shall implement a user-friendly interface
- System shall support scrolling through large datasets
- System shall provide search/filter capabilities

### 5. Export Functionality
