# Pathfinder 2E Traits Data Collection System - Project Plan


## Phase 1: Web Scraping Implementation (Week 2)
### Deliverables:
- [x] Implement website connection module
- [x] Create web scraping logic for main traits page
- [x] Develop link navigation system
- [x] Implement data extraction from linked pages
- [x] Set up error handling and retry mechanisms
- [x] Implement rate limiting and robots.txt compliance
- [x] Create data validation system

## Phase 2: Data Processing and Storage (Week 3)
### Deliverables:
- [x] Run database migration
- [x] Implement duplicate removal system
- [x] Create data categorization logic
- [x] Develop filtering system for non-essential information
- [x] Implement legacy content identification
- [x] Set up source attribution tracking
- [x] Create data storage system
- [x] Implement data backup and recovery

## Phase 3: User Interface Development (Week 4)
### Deliverables:
- [x] Design and implement responsive layout
- [x] Create main data display interface
- [x] Implement search and filter functionality
- [x] Develop navigation controls
- [x] Implement state management
- [x] Design and implement consistent styling

## Phase 3.5: Web Scraping (Week 5)
### Deliverables:
- [x] Add a button to the page to manually tell the app when to scrape *(In Progress: Backend API and frontend UI being implemented)*
- [ ] Add a process to go out to the site: https://2e.aonprd.com/Traits.aspx and investigate the links on the page *(Ready: Scraper logic exists, will be triggered by new API)*
- [ ] Save the scrape data to supabase *(Ready: Scraper saves to Supabase, will be tested via new endpoint)*
- [ ] Create a status indicator or progress bar showing that the process is still working *(Planned: UI update in TraitsTable)*
- [ ] Ensure that the scraped data is categorized and cleaned *(Ready: Scraper already categorizes and cleans data)*
- [ ] Update TraitsTable to show Name, is legacy, primary_source_raw, and summary fields *(In Progress)*

## Phase 4: Export Functionality (Week 5)
### Deliverables:
- [ ] Implement PDF export system
- [ ] Create PDF layout optimization
- [ ] Develop export progress tracking
- [ ] Implement export confirmation system
- [ ] Create export error handling
- [ ] Optimize PDF formatting

## Phase 5: Testing and Quality Assurance (Week 6)
### Deliverables:
- [ ] Conduct data collection accuracy testing
- [ ] Perform load testing
- [ ] Test export functionality
- [ ] Validate data integrity
- [ ] Verify categorization accuracy
- [ ] Test source attribution
- [ ] Conduct user acceptance testing

## Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment (Week 7)
### Deliverables:
- [ ] Create user documentation
- [ ] Write technical documentation
- [ ] Prepare deployment documentation
- [ ] Create maintenance guides
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging
- [ ] Prepare backup and recovery procedures
- [ ] Create update procedures

## Timeline Overview
- Total Duration: 7 weeks
- Start Date: [To be determined]
- End Date: [To be determined]

## Risk Management
### Identified Risks:
